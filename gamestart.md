You are sitting at a computer terminal in a very small cubicle. One of many that stretches for what seems miles. All exactly the same. Your chair is uncomfortable. Your suit doesn't fit quite right today. The flourescent lights above you seem brighter than normal. A cursor blinks on the terminal in front of you. You can use 'type' to enter commands on the computer or exit your cubicle to the south.
