Text-Based-Adventure-Game
=========================

A web based text adventure game

#### Why?
Why not?

#### Will this be a game with elves, swords, wizards, and other shit?
No. This will be a game with thugs, guns, high tech weapons, hackers, and other modern mysterious things. I hate elves and kings.

#### Whats the timeline on this?
There is none. Its just something I am doing to become a better coder. Codecademy and free college courses online can only go so far. 

#### What are you going to write this game in?
I have no idea yet. But i've written the [Opening Scene](https://github.com/skunkworx/Text-Based-Adventure-Game/blob/master/gamestart.md)
